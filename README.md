# Character-Level Name Generation 

## 📌 Overview

This project explores **character-level sequence generation** using different recurrent neural network architectures. The goal is to generate realistic Indian names by modeling sequential dependencies between characters.

We implement and compare:

* Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
* Attention-based RNN

---

## 🧠 Objective

Given a sequence of characters:
[
x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_T)
]

the model learns:
[
P(x) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} P(x_t \mid x_1, ..., x_{t-1})
]

and generates new names character by character.

## ⚙️ Models Implemented

### 1. Vanilla RNN

* Simple recurrent architecture
* Learns sequential dependencies
* Serves as baseline model

---

### 2. BiLSTM

* Processes sequence in both directions
* Uses past + future context
* ❗ Not suitable for generation (explained below)

---

### 3. Attention RNN

* Computes context vector using attention
* Improves long-range dependency modeling
* Produces best results

---

## 🏋️ Training Details

* Framework: PyTorch
* Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
* Optimizer: Adam
* Learning Rate: 0.002
* Epochs: 25

Each name is processed as:

* Input: `<name`
* Target: `name>`

---

## 🔤 Generation Strategy

* Start with token `<`
* Predict next character using softmax
* Use temperature scaling for randomness
* Stop when `>` is generated

---

## ❗ Key Findings

### 🔴 BiLSTM Failure

BiLSTM performs poorly for generation because:

* It learns:
  [
  P(x_t \mid x_{<t}, x_{>t})
  ]
* But during generation:
  [
  P(x_t \mid x_{<t})
  ]

This mismatch causes:

* Empty outputs
* Mode collapse
* Extremely low diversity

---

### 🟢 Best Model: Attention RNN

* Produces coherent names
* Maintains diversity
* Captures long-range dependencies

---

## ⚠️ Failure Modes

* Mode collapse (BiLSTM)
* Premature sequence termination
* Repetition of common surnames
* Overfitting due to small dataset

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use embedding layers instead of one-hot encoding
* Add dropout regularization
* Train on larger datasets
* Explore Transformer-based models

---
